= Social Media

I use the handle '/rahulrajpl/' in all popular social media sites. I intentionally stay away from most of them because those attention engineers are doing such a good job to keep it rolling for me, indefinitely. I am scared. 

You might be interested in [https://stallman.org/ Richard Stallman]'s view on why not to use [https://stallman.org/facebook.html facebook], [https://stallman.org/twitter.html twitter], [https://stallman.org/google.html Google] and many more...I know many of you may disagree. My advice is to use it wisely. 

So the point is, forking me through any social media sites results in nil response with very high probability. Best way to contact me is through [contact.html email]. I am not providing my telephone number for privacy reasons.

My blog will reincarnate soon. I will be updating the details shortly.
