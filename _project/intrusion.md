In this project, experiments were carried out on KDD Cup 99 dataset and the challenge is to classify the network connections as 'good' or 'bad'. 

General details to the challenge is [here](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/task.html)

Dataset for this task is [here](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)

Entire project is worked on Google Colab with GPUs and a nerual net from tensorflow 2.0 library was modelled on full dataset. Accuracy obtianed in 99.75
