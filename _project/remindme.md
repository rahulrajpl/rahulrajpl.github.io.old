title: RemindMe - Android App for Reminder services

Just another experiment to get the feet wet with android development.

One unique feature I have added in this app is the location service which I don't find in any of the reminder apps in play store. 

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/rahulrajpl/ReminderApp) and a short demo as shown below
