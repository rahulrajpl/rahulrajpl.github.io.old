I keep a close watch on or actively use following python packages:- 

 
* Numpy
* Pandas
* tensorflow
* keras
* sklearn
* scipy
* matplotlib

All packages are being managed using `pip`

This post is not final and will be incrementally updated.

Sample highligting of code.

{% highlight python %}

def function():
    pass

# This is a sample python code.
{% endhighlight %}
