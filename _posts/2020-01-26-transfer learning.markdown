### Introduction
-----------------------

Transfer Learning is a technique in Deep Learning in which the model trained in one problem is reused partly in another problem. This technique can be a powerful tool to acquire the highest accuracy with very limited data, which otherwise would not be possible.

Transfer learning is demonstrated using pytorch and pretrained model called vgg16 in [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/121mSI7rwrdEM9CMnmQn1zH260bUtJzqh) colab file.

This lesson is part of tutorial, 'Pytorch for Deep Learning and Computer Vision' by Rayan Slim, Jad Slim, Amer Sharaf and Sarmad Tanveer. It is available in learning.oreilly.com

### Learnings
-----------------------

1. Pretrained model approach to implement transfer learning
2. Various pretrained models in computer vision domain, viz. vgg16, vgg32, alexa, etc.
3. Implementation and practical example to demonstrate
